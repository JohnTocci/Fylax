### üîß Contributing Code

#### Types of Contributions

We welcome:
- Bug fixes
- New features

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run the application to test functionality
   python src/fylax/gui.py
   
   # Test edge cases and error scenarios
   # Ensure existing functionality still works
   ```

4. **Format your code**:
   ```bash
   # Install development tools (if not already installed)
   pip install black isort flake8 mypy
   
   # Format code
   black fylax/
   isort fylax/
   
   # Check for issues
   flake8 fylax/
   mypy fylax/
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new file organization rule type"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve duplicate detection memory issue"
   ```

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

#### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Build process, auxiliary tools, etc.

Examples:
```
feat: add support for regex patterns in advanced rules
fix: resolve crash when organizing empty folders
docs: update installation instructions for macOS
style: format code according to Black standards
refactor: simplify duplicate detection algorithm
test: add unit tests for profile management
chore: update dependencies to latest versions
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some specific preferences:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black default)
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Quotes**: Double quotes for strings
- **Imports**: Use `isort` for import organization
- **Type hints**: Use type hints for all public functions

### Code Organization

```
fylax/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gui.py          # Main GUI application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py         # Core organization engine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py     # Package initialization
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Utility modules (if needed)
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public functions and classes
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic and business decisions
- **Type hints**: Include type hints for better code clarity

Example:
```python
def organize_folder(
    folder_path: str,
    profile_name: Optional[str] = None,
    mode: str = "move",
    dry_run: bool = False
) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """Organize files in a folder based on configured rules.
    
    Args:
        folder_path: Path to the folder to organize
        profile_name: Name of the profile to use (None for active profile)
        mode: Organization mode ('move' or 'copy')
        dry_run: If True, only simulate the organization
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with counts of moved, copied, skipped, and error files
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If folder_path doesn't exist or profile is invalid
    """
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

Always test your changes manually:

1. **Basic functionality**: Ensure core features work
2. **Edge cases**: Test with empty folders, special characters, etc.
3. **Error handling**: Test error scenarios
4. **Cross-platform**: Test on different operating systems if possible

### Test Scenarios

Key scenarios to test:
- Organizing files with basic rules
- Advanced rule patterns
- Dry-run mode functionality
- Undo operations
- Profile switching
- Duplicate detection
- Error handling (permissions, missing files, etc.)

## üìö Documentation
