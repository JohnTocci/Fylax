# CI Fix Verification

This fix addresses the critical CI failure by replacing shell-based conditionals with GitHub Actions native conditionals.

## What was fixed:
- ❌ Before:  (PowerShell parsing error on Windows)  
- ✅ After:  (GitHub Actions conditional)

## Key change:
- Eliminates cross-platform shell compatibility issues
- Uses GitHub Actions native conditional logic
- Maintains exact same functionality (tkinter only installed on Linux)

The core functionality is preserved while fixing the blocking CI error.
